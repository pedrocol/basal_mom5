# The story so far

## Forcing perturbations

Possibly we can come up with better experiment names. Any thoughts?

**BASAL**

Put basal melt component of meltwater at depth instead of at surface. Pedro: Add details of exactly what depths the meltwater goes in at.

Temperature of meltwater is supercold, according to Gade line, which accounts for the latent heat of melting ice. _Pedro: Add details of exactly how this temperature is determined._

Calving component of meltwater is still input at the coast at the surface at normal temperature (min of SST / 0C?).

**BASAL-ICEBERG**

Same as BASAL, but calving (iceberg) component of meltwater is distributed horizontally with the same distribution as Merino et al, and vertically spread evenly over the top X m. _Pedro: add more details of the horizontal distribution - I remember we did some further processing of the Merino data? Also add depth for ice berg melt._

**BASAL-NoGade** 

Same as BASAL, i.e. the basal melt component of the runoff is distributed vertically, and calving component is still at the surface. Except in this case, the temperature of the basal meltwater is ... _Pedro: Add details on how you set the temperature of the meltwater in this case._
